"""** Split this string:**

    s = "Hi there Sam!"
    
**into a list. **
"""

"""** Given the variables:**

    planet = "Earth"
    diameter = 12742

** Use .format() to print the following string: **

    The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
"""

d="The diameter of {planet} is {diameter} kilometers." .format(planet="Earth" , diameter=12742)



"""** Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello" **"""

"""** What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? **"""

# Tuple is immutable
#Tuples operations are safe
